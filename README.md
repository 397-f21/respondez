# RespondEZ
RespondEZ provides event organizers with a simple platform for creating events and keeping track of invitee RSVPs and important information.
The app generates a link to a form that asks for information specified by the event creator.
Invitees can see their admitted or waitlisted status on their dashboard, and the same information also sent to the event organizer.
